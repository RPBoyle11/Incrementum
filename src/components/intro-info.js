        Each test is then processed using a complex algorithm to track which questions you<br/>
        are getting right and which ones you are getting wrong and then tests you more often on<br/>
        the words you keep getting wrong to help you learn them better. Registering allows Italian 5000 <br/>
        to keep track of your progress so each time you login you will resume learning where<br/>
        you left off.</p>
